## The challenge

A simple and responsive QR Code component built using HTML and CSS. This project is part of the Frontend Mentor challenge and helps improve front-end skills by practicing layout and styling techniques.

The challenge was to build a QR code component and match the design as closely as possible. I successfully completed it with clean and responsive HTML and CSS. This project allowed me to practice and enhance my front-end skills while ensuring pixel-perfect design implementation.
